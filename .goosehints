# SimilarTeia Project Guide

## Project Overview
SimilarTeia is a web application that allows users to create and explore connections/similarities between books. The application uses the Nostr protocol for decentralized social networking and data sharing. Users can:

1. Login with Nostr extensions/wallets
2. Create "similarity events" between two books
3. Explore similarity connections created by the community
4. Rate the degree of similarity between books

### Future Expansion
While the current implementation focuses on books only, the project is designed to eventually support:
- Music similarities
- Movie similarities
- Cross-media similarities (books-to-movies, music-to-books, etc.)

This phased approach allows for a focused initial release while setting the foundation for a comprehensive similarity network across different media types.

## Technical Stack
- React with TypeScript
- Vite for building and development
- React Router for navigation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn-ui components library
- Nostr protocol for decentralized data
- WebSocket connections to Nostr relays
- OpenLibrary API for book data

## Key Components
- `NostrContext.tsx` - Manages authentication and Nostr connections
- `nostr.ts` - Library for Nostr protocol interactions (connect, publish, subscribe)
- `openlibrary.ts` - Integration with OpenLibrary API for book search and metadata
- Main Pages:
  - Index - Home/landing page
  - Create - For creating new book similarity events
  - Explore - For discovering similarity events
  
## Important Concepts
- Nostr Protocol - Decentralized network for social content
- Book Similarity Events - Custom Nostr events (kind 1729) that connect two books
- WebSocket Relays - Communication channels for Nostr events (using relay.damus.io)
- OpenLibrary Integration - External API for book search and metadata retrieval

## Architecture
- Context-based state management with React Context API
- Component-based UI architecture with shadcn/UI components
- WebSockets for real-time Nostr event data
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- Data flow model:
  1. User searches for books using OpenLibrary API
  2. Selected books are used to create similarity events
  3. Events are published to Nostr relays via WebSockets
  4. Events are fetched from relays and displayed in the UI
  5. Book metadata is enriched with OpenLibrary API data when displayed

## Nostr Event Example
Below is an example of a book similarity event in the Nostr protocol format:

```json
{
  "kind": 1729,
  "id": "31552bd0459c07811858af3f3035507b98bacbdf05df17a9dcedbe4c8025db27",
  "pubkey": "47259076c85f9240e852420d7213c95e95102f1de929fb60f33a2c32570c98c4",
  "created_at": 1743545886,
  "tags": [
    ["i", "isbn:9781729527085"],
    ["kind", "isbn"],
    ["i", "isbn:1639940251"],
    ["kind", "isbn"],
    ["similarity", "0.92"]
  ],
  "content": "Those books are related because they talk about the laws of the universe. The Kybalion is more focused on it while The Land of the Gods focuses on it in a more fiction way, but without getting too much fiction so you don't waste your time.\nHighly recommend both of them.",
  "sig": "d94b75131963fd81d58350e5f160254a780f2c27c36ffe7c1c1616cec799f31bc79b09515087d353fd4c6d1845819267db7bbef5cb77aab62cd553f6358dc1be"
}
```

Key components of the event:
- `kind: 1729` - Custom event kind for similarity events
- `tags` - Contains two items with ISBNs and a similarity rating
- `content` - The user's explanation of why these books are similar
- Other fields are standard Nostr event metadata (id, pubkey, timestamp, signature)

## Development Guidelines
- Authentication requires a Nostr browser extension
- Events are published to and fetched from Nostr relays
- Book data structure includes ISBN, title, and author information
- Similarity events contain two books and a similarity rating (0-1)
- Future media types will follow a similar pattern but with different identifiers:
  - Movies will likely use IMDb IDs or similar standardized identifiers
  - Music will likely use MusicBrainz IDs, Spotify URIs, or similar identifiers
  - All media types will maintain the same event structure with appropriate `kind` tags
